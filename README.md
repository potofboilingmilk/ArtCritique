# ArtCritique
A simple neural network written in Python: one meant to learn how to like (or hate) art.

# Requirements
This program was written in Python 3; make sure your version is up-to-date, and there should be no problem.

This program also utilizes the following libraries:


  1.) OpenCV2


  2.) imutils


If you don't have these libraries, the program **WON'T WORK!** So be careful!

If you encounter any bugs or problems, please let me know; or try to commit, or something. You're a free person.
