# ArtCritique
A simple neural network written in Python: one meant to learn how to like (or hate) art.

# Requirements
This program was written in Python 3; make sure your version is up-to-date, and there should be no problem.

This program also utilizes the following libraries:


  1.) OpenCV2


  2.) imutils


If you don't have these libraries, the program **WON'T WORK!** So be careful!

If you encounter any bugs or problems, please let me know; or try to commit, or something. You're a free person.

# Running the Program

Execute the .py script in any IDE or console of your choice. I personally used IDLE, which is built-into Python.

Make sure that you put this script in a folder, and that no special permissions are required to change or make files in that folder: this program produces a text file for storing weights.

All image inputs **must** be in the same folder as the main .py script file.

When running this program for the first time, you'll need to train it on at least one image (to teach it what it likes). Training it is as simple as following the directions IN the program.
